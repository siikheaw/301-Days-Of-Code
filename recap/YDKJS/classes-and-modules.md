# How we organize in JS

Two major patterns for organizing code (data and behavior) : **classes** and **modules**.

## Classes
A class in a program is a definition of a **"type"** of custom data structure that includes both data and behaviors that operate on that data.
Classes define how such a data structure works, but classes are not themselves concrete values. To get a concrete value that you can use in the program, a class must be instantiated (with the new keyword) one or more times.
