## Paradigms
Typical paradigm-level code categories include: procedural, object-oriented (OO/classes), and functional (FP).
1. Procedural style organizes code in a top-down, linear progression through a pre-determined set of operations, usually collected together in related units called procedures.
2. OO style organizes code by collecting logic and data together into units called classes.
3. FP style organizes code into functions (pure computations as opposed to procedures), and the adaptations of those functions as values.

Paradigms are neither right nor wrong. They're orientations that guide and mold how programmers approach problems and solutions, how they structure and maintain their code.

### Values
Values are data. Values come in two forms in JS: primitive and object.

#### Primitive values
1. Strings
2. Numbers
3. Booleans
4. null
5. undefined
6. Symbols

#### Objects
1. Functions - special type (sub-type) of object.
2. Arrays - special type (sub-type) of object that's comprised of an ordered and numerically indexed list of data.
3. Objects - unordered, keyed collection of any various values.
