# Variables

## Declaring and Using Variables
Variables have to be declared (created) to be used.
1. `var` - declared a variable with optionally allows an initial assignment of a value.
2. `let` - "block scoping" -- limited access to the variable in block scope and function scope, which helps prevent accidental overlap of their names.
3. `const` - must be given a value at the moment it's declared, and cannot be re-assigned a different value later.
