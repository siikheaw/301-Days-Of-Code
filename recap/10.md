# Day 10: JavaScript30: Array Cardio Day 1  

## Array methods

### `filter`   
Use filter if you already have an array, and you want to grab certain values that match a criteria from that array — e.g., even numbers, words longer than 10 characters, etc.  
```js
// 1. Filter the list of inventors for those who were born in the 1500's
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
const fifteen = inventors.filter(inventor => (inventor.year > 1500 && inventor.year < 1600));
```
### `map`
Use map if you already have an array, and you want to perform the same action on every element in the array and return the same number of elements in a new array.
```js
// 2. Give us an array of the inventors' first and last names
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
const fullName = inventors.map(inventor => `${inventor.first} ${inventor.last}`);
```
### `sort`
```js
// 3. Sort the inventors by birthdate, oldest to youngest
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
const ordered = inventors.sort((a, b) => (a.year > b.year) ? 1 : -1);
```

### `reduce`  
Use reduce if you already have an array, but you want to use the values in that array to create something new.
```js
const totalYears = inventors.reduce(function(total, inventor) {
  return total + (inventor.passed - inventor.year);
}, 0)
```
